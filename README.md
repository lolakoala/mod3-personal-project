# Tribe: A Communal Living Management App

This app was written with React, Redux, and Router on the front end and Firebase on the back end. 

It is not currently deployed. I am in the proccess of re-creating with Node on the back end and either React Native or Angular on the front end. I'm currently working on the backend, and you can stay up-to-date with my progress [here](https://github.com/lolakoala/new-tribe-backend).

Pulling down the application to play with it locally is problematic due to the use of Firebase. 

A user can either create their own house and distribute the house code to their house members, or they can use a house code to join an existing house.

From their dashboard, a user can see any unread bulletins or other actionable items, such as bills they need to mark as paid or chores assigned to them that are not yet marked as done.

Highlights of the app include the ability to assign bills to house members via a variety of splits, posting chores that the user can claim for themselves or designate unclaimed so that other members can claim them, and posting bulletins for members to read.

From an individual item, any house member can see what actions other house members have taken regarding that item. 

This app is geared toward egalitarian households where members share responsibility with no member necessarily being "in charge". There is no admin feature for this app.

As I rebuild this app, I hope to add an events calendar, a grocery list feature, and interact with a money-handling service, such as Venmo.
